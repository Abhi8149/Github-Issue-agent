Database Issues

1. Database not appearing in the website folder:
- The issue describes a situation where a database file is not appearing in the expected directory after creation.
- The problem was resolved by moving the database file to the correct directory manually.
- The user suggests that the database file might have been created in an unexpected directory (e.g., an "instances" folder) and then moved to the "website" folder.

2. Database not being created:
- The issue describes a situation where a database file is not being created at all.
- The error message indicates that the `create_all()` method is being called with an unexpected keyword argument `app`.
- The problem might be due to an incorrect usage of the `create_all()` method. The `create_all()` method should be called without the `app` argument.
